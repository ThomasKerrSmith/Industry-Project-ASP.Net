# Industry-Project-ASP.Net
This ASP.NET application serves as a comparative study to an Node.js app, exploring and contrasting their development approaches. Through this project, I aim to showcase the capabilities and features of ASP.NET while highlighting its differences from other technologies. Feel free to explore the functionalities and contribute to the ongoing comparison.
